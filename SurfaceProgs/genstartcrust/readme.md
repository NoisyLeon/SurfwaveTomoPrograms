Usage of __genstartcrust__:
---------------------------
1. The inversion routine assumes there is a crustal model supplied 
on some regular lat-lon grid.  A 0.25-degree grid is used for _a priori_ 
crustal model, which is generated by **gencruststart3.f**  and assumes a 
laterally constant mantle model (**mantlemodel2.dat**, which currently extends 
down to 460 km.  If you don't want to allow variations that deep, you'll 
need to change this file and also the **lowmantle3.d** file in the  
directory **genpredphsevel/**).  

2. Program **gencruststart5.f** generates a starting model that has a non-uniform 
mantle, in this case in the form of percentage perturbations from a body 
wave tomography inversion (Brandoninput3).  

3. Crustal thickness measurements at scattered points are provided, from P to 
S receiver functions H-k analysis at many stations (file **Crust-thick2**), 
which are then laterally averaged in the **gencruststart** programs.  
**Brandoninput1** is an example input file to **gencruststart3.f**
